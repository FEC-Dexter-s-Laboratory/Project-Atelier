The Questions and Answers component consist of two(2) main sections: The search bar, and the questions list

Search Bar:

The search bar allows the user to search for any given question, showing the results as a list of questions that contain the given input, or a text telling the user that no results were found.

Question List:

The question list contains all the questions and their respective answers for a given product. Upon page load, 2 questions or less are rendered with each question having one answer or less. If there are more questions or answers to be shown, a show more button is rendered to allow the user to load more questions and answers if they so choose.

The question list and each individual question have a button to add any question or answer of their own, that when pressed, brings up a form modal that allows the use to submit their questions or answers to the api.
