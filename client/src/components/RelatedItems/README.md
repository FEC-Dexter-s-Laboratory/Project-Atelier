The related products component consists of two carousel - one for products related to the main product, and one for your outfits. Each of these carousel contains cards of the same layout.

Each card contains an image, name, category, price, and rating for the product. Clicking anywhere on the card other than the comparison button or the removal button will direct the user to that product's display page. Hovering over the image will display a carousel of preview images for that product, and clicking on the preview images will change the image of the card to the clicked image even when no longer hovering.

The related products carousel holds cards for products related to the currently displayed product. Each card has a star button that opens a comparison table window so that their features can be compared side-by-side.

The outfits carousel is a place for you to save your customized outfit. It starts off with an empty list and a card that you can click to add the currently displayed product to your outfit. Each product can only be added once, and the list will persist upon page reload due to use of local storage. There is a button on the outfit card to remove it from the list.
