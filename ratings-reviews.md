The Ratings & Reviews module provides a breakdown of ratings and characteristics of the currently displayed product, alongside a filterable and sortable list of available reviews. By clicking on any of the individual rating sidebars, a filter for reviews of that rating is toggled for the overall review list. Additionally, the review list can be expanded (if applicable) by clicking the "More Reviews" button below and can be sorted via the dropdown menu above. This functionality provides significant customization based on each individual user's needs. 

The module also has deep functionality in the expandable "Add Review" modal, which validates all required user data prior to submission, and conditionally renders characteristic rating selectors for a given product. This module also allows a user to upload local photos, sending asynchronous Axios calls to a hosting API and submitting the appropriate data to the site's primary review data storage API.

These features were created using a stack of React, Axios, Express, Styled-Components, MomentJS, and the Cloudinary API.
